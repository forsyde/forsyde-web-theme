# Acknowledgements

This site was published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), using an in-house [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme called [forsyde-web-theme](https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-web-theme). The visual profile is closely following the [Slate Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate), but much of the code has also been inspired and imported from the [Jekyll Bootstrap Doc](https://github.com/mistic100/jekyll-bootstrap-doc) and the [Jekyll Documentation Theme](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html) projects. 

Some icons are embedded using [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) fonts.
